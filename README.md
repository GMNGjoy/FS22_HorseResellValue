# Horse Resell Value
The one animal in FarmingSimulator22 that doesn't really have a purpose is Horses. You can buy them, raise them, and you're forced to ride them every day and the only thing you can do is sell them... for chump change. Well, that's not fun! Let's make horses actually profitable!

**PC only** due to script usage.


## Description from the ModDesc
> It's time to make raising horses worth more! This script mod increases the sell price of horses to be more accurate with the work you put into them, and even makes them a bit cheaper to buy!
>
> Sell Price at 36 months: 50,000 (peak price)\
> Sell Price at 60 months: 40,000

> Special Thanks to Dustbunny for the idea!

## Installation Instructions
1. Download this package from GitHub on the releases page, save the `FS22_HorseResellValue.zip` into your mod folder.

## Note
This mod will overwrite any prices set by any modded map; For example, if you're using the map "Hinterland" which has a sell price at 36 months for Horses of 40,000 - this mod will override that sell price to 50,000.
